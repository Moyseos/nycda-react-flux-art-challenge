# NYCDA React Fluxification Challenge

The following app displays a gallery of art. However, right now the components
are stubbed out with dummy data, despite our data store being in `App.jsx`'s
state. There are also functions to get art data, favorite art, and toggle the
list to only show favorites that aren't hooked up yet either. So to finish this
app off, do the following:

1. _Fork_ the repository, and _clone_ (NOT DOWNLOAD) your new repo
2. Edit the routes in `App.jsx` to send the appropriate data and action function
props to the page components
3. Hook up the data correctly inside of the Page components
4. Call or bind the prop action functions as needed
5. Once everything functions well, open a pull request with your changes
